# Ui navigation

A generic UI navigation algorithm meant to be adaptable to any UI library, but
currently limiting itself to targeting the Bevy engine default UI library.

The design document is [available here](https://github.com/nicopap/rfcs/blob/ui-navigation/rfcs/41-ui-navigation.md).

## Structure

This repo contains two crates:
* `generic`: An implementation of the navigation algorithm using the classical
  tree data structure. It is here for reference and as an help to understand
  the algorithm for people not necessarilly familiar with ECS.
* `bevy`: A completely independent implementation of the same algorithm using
  the bevy ECS. It doesn't at all depend on `generic`.

## Roadmap

[X] Basic flat hierarchy 2D navigation (requires element location deduction)
[ ] Hierarchical navigation with Action/Cancel (requires tree layer without
    an active trail)
[ ] Tabbed navigation demo (requires Forward/Backward commands support)
[ ] Complex hierarchy with focus memory (requires tree)
